## Pressing buttons together

Let's start your program when the A and B buttons are pressed together.



+ Go to <a href="https://rpf.io/microbit-new" target="_blank">rpf.io/microbit-new</a> to start a new project in the MakeCode (PXT) editor. Call your new project 'Rate Your Mates'.

+ When the micro:bit starts, display an image showing that both buttons should be pressed.

You can use scrolling text instead of an image if you prefer.

+ A rating shouldn't be shown until __both buttons are pressed__. Add a new `on button A+B pressed` event to your project.

+ Add code to show a question mark for 1 second, to build the suspense before giving the friends their rating.

+ Test our your code. When you press buttons __A and B together__, a question mark should flash onto the screen.
